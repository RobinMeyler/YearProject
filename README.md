Robin Meyler: Final Year Project

Title: GPU acceleration of A* pathfinding with the Vulkan API

Using the Parallel design of the GPU to execute AStar on many agents at once with the intention of measuring the performance improvement/difference. Using the Vulkan API as the interfacing API as it is the modern and more explicit API for Graphics programming that utilizes many cores and is designed with off-screen rendering and GPU parallel thread use in mind.
